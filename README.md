## IPControl \- Get All the IPs your system can send data thru


</div>

### Description

As stated by the name, this ActiveX Control will obtain all the IP Addresses your computer owns. Useful in situation where you have multiple IP addresses, such as networked systems, that have one (or more) IPs for the network, and one (or more, hehe) for Internet. *Note* This is not my code. The original code is from an author I met on IRC. I forget the name, but if you see this, Tell me! :) (I'm BaronGaran btw.) I did, however, convert it from project form to Control form. Hope you guys enjoy, and if you vote, remember you're not voting for me but for the original author.
